## Goal
I need gif to write a blog, so I make a program that converts it to gif as soon as I capture the screen

## Stack
- C# (.Net Framework 4.7.2), SharpAVI (2.2.1)

## Period 
- 2022-05-20 ~ present

## Difficulties
- Openv and directX were not used because they would force clients to install additional programs.
- SharpAVI 3.0.0 used version 2.2.1 because it was difficult to use due to the absence of examples and manuals.

## Result
- be able to record on the screen.
